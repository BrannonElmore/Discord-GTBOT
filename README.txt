_______EDITING CONSTANTS_______

Go into bot.js and edit constants between the //==EDIT== comments near the top.

GOD_ID: Should be the Discord ID for whomever is running the bot. This gives you override commands regardless of your permissions.
	Use this for good, not evil. It's to let you test things and help other users.

WARSIGNUP_ID and _S: Should be the ID for your war signup channel in discord.

NO_EMOTE/YES_EMOTE: The name of your no and yes emotes for reacting to signups.
NO_EMOTE_ID/YES_EMOTE_ID: The ID of the same no and yes emotes.

BOT_REACT_STARTER: The <@&ID> string the bot uses when pinging people to signup for war/siege/practice. 
	For example, @filter resolved to <@&607515236928323587>.

BOT_PATH: The root directory where you've placed this bot.

NW_SIGNUP_IMG: relative file path to the image used Nodewar Signups.
SIEGE_SIGNUP_IMG: relative file path to the image used Siege Signups.
PRAC_SIGNUP_IMG: relative file path to the image used Practice Signups.


_______Other Info_______
1) Make sure you have a \Private folder in the root directory for your bot. This is where I placed images used by the bot.
2) The command "react_to remind" doesn't work. I never fixed it. Remind people to sign up for wars manually.
	2a) The rest of the "react_to" commands work fine. Use them to tell your guild to sign up for things.


_______Lewd Info_______
If you want the 'send_feet' command to work, you need to put an image named 'fine.jpg' in your \Private folder.
I never used this for real feet pics, just random images of robot feet found on google images that I thought were funny.
But uh..yeah..you do you bud.

There's also a "send_nudes" command, but it doesn't send images. It just yells at you for asking for noods.

_______Contact_______
If you already know me on discord, then just DM me. 
If you don't already know me on discord, find someone who does to DM me. 
Otherwise, good luck! lol.
